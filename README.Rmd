This portfolio showcases my skill in clear data visualization and ethical visual rhetoric. It is the culmination of my work in the class ME447 Visualising Data. Each display required creating one or more graphics and writing an essay on the data characteristics and my decisions on how to graph it effectively. This class focused on visual rhetoric, which is essentially the process of tailoring graphic decisions to your audience with the goals of clarity and truthfulness.

All of the work done here is using R, a programming language for data manipulation and visualization. At the beginning of this class I did not know what R was, and at the end I am proficient in using it and have created all the displays below.
