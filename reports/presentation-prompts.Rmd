## D1 distributions 

State the number of observations: 706

List the variables: 
- Annual Earnings Post Graduation 
- School Type: Public and Private
- School Student Demographic: High ACT & High Need, High ACT & Low Need, Low ACT & High Need, Low ACT & Low Need

State the graph type: Strip Plot

Explain why the graph type is suited to the data structure:  

- Since there is not a huge number of observations, a strip plot depicts the actual data.
- There are four clear categories, and the reader will want to compare them, which is easily done with the common x-axis.

Explain each design choice and cite its supporting reference 

- I grouped the Above and Below average test score categories, because students wanting to know the best path will know which group they fit into based on their own test scores. This choice makes it easier for the audience to answer their own question. Wainer, Howard (2014)
- choice, reference 

Comments from peers 

- The data structure satisfies the portfolio display requirements.
- ACT score is a continuous quantative variable, this will tell a different story when it is shown as such, not as a block category.
- Find and communicate any background or limitations on the data. Is there a specific time span, or were some observations included or not? I currently do not know these things about my college earnings data, but they are important to the story.
- Categorizing by large and small schools may be useful, but the data set does not have that data.
- Initially I thought each dot was a student, but in fact it is a college. Test scores, earnings, and need fractions represent medians for the students who attended the school.
