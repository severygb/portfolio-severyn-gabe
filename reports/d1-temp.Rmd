## A title

Visualization is a great place to start with R programming, because the payoff is 
so clear: you get to make elegant and informative plots that help you understand 
data [@Wickham+Grolemund:2017]. 

Choosing the correct data to include in a report is incredibly important because "displays of evidence implicitly but powerfully define the scope of the relevant, as presentd data are selected from a larger pool of material" [@Tufte:1997]

## An equation

$$
m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = F
$$
