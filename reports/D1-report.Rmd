## Story

College earnings are not strongly predicted by the demographics of students entering schools.

This dataset is derived from MONEY's best college rankings [@DASL]. This is an annual study done on colleges in the US focusing on identifying schools that offer the most value to students and their families, as well as top performers in various academic metrics. Each datapoint is one of the 706 (Minimum of 200 for D1) four-year colleges MONEY studied that year, which are colleges in the Unites States meeting a [few criteria](https://money.com/how-money-ranks-best-colleges-2019/) [@MONEY:2019]. 

The distribution of earnings by the financial-academic demographic categories brings stereotypes to the forefront: the 'have-it-alls' (affluent and smart), or the underpriveleged (lower test scores and low-income families). Stereotypes at their core are based in truth, and some will see that reinforced in this graphic. The demographic categories are ordered by median salary, and as most would expect, colleges with a high median ACT score produce graduates that tend to be high earners. However, looking deeper this graphic tells a different story. Earnings between each demographic category overlap greatly. In fact, there is only an $8,200 difference between the highest and lowest median earnings. The demographics that attend a college are not a significant factor in determining earnings after college.

```

Earnings is the average salary of graduates five years out. The ACT test score is the median for incoming students at each college, which is broken up into higher than average and lower than average categories. Financial need is reported as the fraction of students which recieve financial aid, broken into above and below average categories. It only counts aid given for need (not academic merit), but there is no distinction made between federal aid and private scholarships. The values splitting the categories are displayed in the figure subtitle: average ACT score is 25, average percentage of students needing aid is 57%.

One important piece of background information this dataset is missing is the year the study refers to. From browsing MONEY's recent college ranking lists, I determined this dataset is from no later than 2014. Missing this context surrounding the data limits the conclusions we can draw - i.e. prospective college students should not place stock in analysis from this display, and should seek the most recent information. However, at the time this data was current, it offered insights into the profile of students entering colleges across the US.

## Graph design

According to Doumount, a strip plot is effective for comparing data with one continuous variable and one or more categorical variables [@Doumont:2009]. The collegiate earnings dataset fits this criteria, and we are interested in comparing the earnings of each demographic making a strip plot appropriate. The resulting graphic shows the distribution of the single quantitative variable (earnings) over the two categorical variables (ACT score and need amount), with two levels each (above and below average). None of the variables are time based, as those are best represented with different types of graphs.

Choosing the correct data to include in a report is incredibly important because "displays of evidence implicitly but powerfully define the scope of the relevant, as presentd data are selected from a larger pool of material" [@Tufte:1997]. This subset of data divides each college's student body into a demographic based on economic status and academic performance, a combination not often examined.

The x-axis is formatted with dollar signs and trailing zeros directly on the labels, because this is the way people are used to looking at currency values. In this form, the numeric value is understood at a glance. This format is possible because the axis has few major grid lines, so the longer labels do not overlap or impede readability.

The need-performance demographic is constructed by the author, so to improve transparency the values that split the categories is included as a subtitle. With this additional information, a student identify the potential earnings range for a college that accept students with similar scores. Including the average values is also an ethical requirement; disclosing how categories were created means the author cannot hide misleading information.

This data set had very few missing values, visualized by the VIM package. The spine plot below looks at the four variables that make up the data displayed in the strip plot. Suprisingly, only the need fraction 'NF' contained missing values, shown by the combination with a darkened panel for NF.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}   
include_graphics("../figures/D1-missing-values.png")    
```

With only 19 missing out of 706 observations (2.7%), incomplete observations were simply omitted with very little change to the graphical story.
