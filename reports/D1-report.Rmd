## D1: Strip Plot

- Introductory prose to start each report describing the data and the requirements being met (from R Markdown basics)
- Describe the type of story being told with relevant citationsâ€”recall the paper by Doumont (2009)
- Explain how the graph design is appropriate to the data structure
- Explain your rationale for important design elements with relevant citations
- Explain the application of basic principles in graph design and visual rhetoric that we have discussed and that you have noted in your discussion notes (reading responses, video reflections, and presentation notes) with relevant citations

This display meets the requirements for D1 distribution data display: 

  - Minimum 200 observations of one quantitative variable
  - One or two categorical variables
  - Time is excluded as a variable
  - Two categorical variables, with two levels each for a minimum of four comparisons.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}   
#include_graphics("../figures/!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()_+")    
```    

This data is derived from MONEY's
I can not find what year this data is from, which limits the conclusions we can draw from the context. From browsing MONEY's college rankings, I determined this dataset is from no later than 2014, so current prospective college students should not place stock in decisions from this display. However, at the time this data was current, it offered a great insight into the profile of students entering colleges across the US.

Choosing the correct data to include in a report is incredibly important because "displays of evidence implicitly but powerfully define the scope of the relevant, as presentd data are selected from a larger pool of material" [@Tufte:1997]

Notes to myself on improvements to be made:

- Communicate how the rows are ordered
- essay: include limitations on data, talk about techincal and rhetorical choices
- Show Above and Below average correspond to ACT scores
- Cite data source in figure caption
- Format X axis in standard currency form
