## A title

Visualization is a great place to start with R programming, because the
payoff is so clear: you get to make elegant and informative plots that
help you understand data (Wickham and Grolemund
[2017](#ref-Wickham+Grolemund:2017)).

Choosing the correct data to include in a report is incredibly important
because “displays of evidence implicitly but powerfully define the scope
of the relevant, as presentd data are selected from a larger pool of
material” (Tufte [1997](#ref-Tufte:1997))
