## Reflections on Rhetoric

**Prompt:** For each of the two authors you select, reflect on their
ideas and their messages. What is the most significant idea you can
borrow from them that you can apply to your own portfolio? Make your
responses as specific as you can.

**Response:** Eric Rodenbeck (maps of emotion)

The most significant idea I took from the excerpt of Eric’s talk is to
connect graphics and data to people. He did an excellent job of
humanizing data, and tying that data to meaningful emotions in the
audience. His graphics were visually designed around the emotion a
person seeing it would be feeling: the Middle east casuality map was
respectful, somber, and instilled the viewer with empathy.

**Response:** David McCandless (the billion-dollar-o-gram)

The idea that struck me the most from David McCandless’ talk is highly
related to this class, and to my profession. In engineering, we solve
problems in everyday life, but there are always several layers of
abstraction between how engineers think about a problem or solution, and
how everyone else thinks about that same thing. Engineering is about
numbers, but for anyone not intimately familiar with that specific
metric, the numbers are meaningless. McCandless’ lesson was to provide
context for incomprehensible numbers by comparing them. Comparison
across a broad spectrum of topics means that many more people are likely
to understand the meaning behind the data.
