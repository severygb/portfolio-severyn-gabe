## Week 2 Reading prompts

Tufte, Edward (1997) The decision to launch the space shuttle
Challenger. In: *Visual and statistical thinking: Displays of evidence
for making decisions.* Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press, 16–31.

**Prompt:** Tufte says, “Regardless of the indirect cultural causes of
the accident, there was a clear proximate cause.” Summarize Tufte’s
explanation of the proximate cause.

**Response:** The engineers correctly concluded that lower temperatures cause the rubber o-rings to lose resiliency, which can potentially lead to seal failures. The evidence they presented to NASA and management was muddled with irrelevent data and unclear graphs. Unclear visual evidence misled the decision makers and did not convey the link between low temperatures and seal failures.

**Prompt:** Describe the evidence the author presents to support those
ideas.

**Response:** Data from all previous launches ordered by temperature shows a clear trend in o-ring damage: colder launches resulted in more seal  damage. Tufte shows the graphs and charts presented by the engineers, which are unhelpful and bury important information.

**Prompt:** What data were used in making the decision to launch? What
data were not used but should have been used (according to Tufte) in
making the launch decision?

**Response:** Data for blow-by was presented, which is not the failure mechanism they are interested in. Charts and tables refer to data from qualification rockets, which is not a valid comparison because those rockets are not flying. None of this data should have been used in the decision making, and it only muddied the water. Data from successful launches was not used, bue should have because it establishes an accurate comparison for flights with seal damage.

**Prompt:** On page 23, Tufte presents a graph that provides visual
evidence that the “launch was completely outside the engineering
database accumulated in 24 previous flight.” Describe the structure of
this data set:

  - Number of observations
  - Data structure: classify each variable as quantitative (continuous
    or discrete) and categorical (nominal or ordinal and number of
    levels).

**Response:** It included 23 observations (24 total flights occurred, but one rocket was not recovered). The calculated variable 'o-ring damage index' is quantitative continuous. Launch temperature is quantitative continuous data. He also included the forecasted temperature range on launch day to illustrate how far it was from proven conditions.

**Prompt:** Summarize the main thesis of the paper.

**Response:** The Challenger launch decision was flawed by poor visual rhetoric, unclear evidence, and lacking logical analysis that obscured the intended message.
