**RL comments**

ACT scores are quantitative, suggests a scatterplot because you said you were interested in a correlation between ACT score and potential earnings

What is the provenance of the data? How many years? What set of colleges? etc.

**RL** I could not fix the knitr problem with relative file paths. So I have used a workaround. See the work I added to the `0301-markdowen-basics.Rmd` script.  Before knitting the script, install the `magick` package.
