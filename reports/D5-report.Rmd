What kind of lie is it? (See graphical lies slides for types)
Look to put the data in context: add more years? surrounding areas?

Map projection of original is true, uses the Molleweide projection which more accurately portrays land area (need a citation). Many graphs use the Mercatur projection, which distorts the globe in such a way that North American and European countries seem larger.

They avoided value laden colors - their scheme has absolutely no meaning. Color could be used to make certain countries or continents more prominent or impart emotional or political biases.

The countries are grouped, roughly by continent. I can only deduce this was necessary because the map does not have enough space to write each countrie's data. Grouping by global region means a single mean can be displayed, which is representative of that region's data. Since I am representing each countries motorization rate on a color scale and not in a written number, the groupings are not necessary for the data to be legible.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}   
include_graphics("../figures/D4-motorsports-fatalities.png")    
```

## Graph design
 
Data requirements

- Minimum 20 observations
- One quantitative variable conveying information about human injury or fatality
- One or two categorical variables, one of which can be time (time series)

Normalizing the fatalities would be more appropriate in this case because it would account for the changing number of participants. However, after searching, I could not find data for the number of participants across all racing types and series to match the fatalities context.

Why is this graph type appropriate? design decisions, especially lie content and how I fixed it
