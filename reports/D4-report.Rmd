There are three primary threats to a race car driver: high g-load, object intrusion, and fire [@Smith:2019]. Most types of injuries are caused by accidents involving these threats and improvements in safety technology primarily target them. Automobile racing is a recent sport; a popular saying is the first race occurred shortly after the creation of the second car. However, the global motorsports community only began to look at crashes and injuries in a scientific manner in the 1990's, furthering technology for safety improvements and studying how to mitigate risks for drivers, crew members, and spectators [@Tyler:2006]. It took decades of dangerous competition and major improvements in technology before the global community coalesced around safety for specatators and participants. This hundred-odd years of data represents the lives of drivers, spectators, crew members, safety personel, and officals who lost their life in a motorsports incident.

This data only includes car and truck racing (not motorcycles or boats) in the US. Motor racing is a global sport so there are thousands of individuals and hundreds of race series that are not accounted here. The vast majority of individuals killed in the sport are drivers but incidents can happen anywhere on and off track. Small numbers of rescue personel, team members, and fans are part of this dataset, but every loss of life is equal in weight and must be included in safety considerations.

Some of the most influential and effective safety advances are highlighted for context. There is an accelerating rate in safety advances; very few improvements happened before the 1950's but so many occurred in the past 20 years they could not be labeled. This follows the rate of technological advances in the information age. The improvements labeled directly address the three primary threats in motorsports accidents.

Some important sections of the graph must be noted. During the second World War fatalities dropped to zero, simply because no motorsports events happened during the time. 

Several of the safety improvements are a direct result of a fatal accident driving action. In 1958 Pat O'Connor lost his life in major car pile-up at the Indianapolis 500. The very next year roll over hoops were mandated [@Nye:2017]. There is a spike followed by continual decline in fatalities at the turn of the 21st century. A string of high-profile deaths including Dale Earnheardt and Adam Petty prompted a massive response from the racing community to make changes. HANS devices were mandated in NASCAR as a direct result of Earnheardt, since the device directly prevents the type of skull fracture he suffered [@Tyler:2006].

There is a story here that this graph does not address - the data I obtained makes no distinction between professional and amateur drivers. A national or international series, such as NASCAR or F1, has the resources and knowledge to drive advancements in safety technology, and the ability to mandate equipment within the series. Professional and manufacture-backed teams have enough budget to afford the safest equipment available. Amateur racing is the exact opposite. Drivers and teams at local race tracks can not afford top-tier equipment. Local tracks can not afford to fit energy-absorbing wall material at a cost upwards of \$500 a foot [@Smith:2019]. There has been a trickle-down effect for safety improvements, especially in helmets, restraint harnesses, fuel cells, and the knowledge to build a strong driver protection cabin. Even the budget-centric racing series 24 Hours of LeMons, where cars must cost below \$500, enforces *strict* safety protocols for crash safety and fire prevention.



## Graph design
 
Data requirements

- Minimum 20 observations
- One quantitative variable conveying information about human injury or fatality
- One or two categorical variables, one of which can be time (time series)

A line graph is appropriate for this data because it shows the evolution of a variable over time [@Doumont:2009]. The variable is not continuous, rather it is discreet over each year. Points are real data while the line is just connecting the dots, but the line is easily "understood as connected, but not interpolated, by the line" [@Doumont:2009]. Markers are not displayed at each point to keep ink to a minumum and fit the simple and somber theme. Human suffering is the central focus, not comparing data points or reducing lives to statistics [@Dragga+Voss:2001].

Normalizing the fatalities would be more appropriate in this case because it would account for the changing number of participants. That number likely varies widely between 1902 and 2019, however I was not able find data for the number of participants across all racing types and series to match context with the fatalities data.

The first thing the viewer sees the man in a racing helmet and safety gear. This picture immediately conveys the individuality of lives lost, showing 'who' is affected by this injurious data [@Dragga+Voss:2001]. Someone who suffered for their passion, who participated in a dangerous sport because they loved the feelings, competition, or community invloved. The man solemly gazing away imparts a variety of emotions to viewers. Anyone personally involved in motorsports will recognize the scene: the moment of calm right before the race starts and chaos has the potential to arise. 

The image fades to white beneath the figure with the goal of showing they are inseparable. Great care was taken to make sure the data lines, grid lines, and annotation rectangles do not visually conflict, but rather integrate into a cohesive and "mutually illuminative" display [@Stroupe:2000].

Information encoded in the annotations on racing safety advances comes from the following sources.

- HANS devices [@Tyler:2006]
- nomex fire suits [@Houston:2012]
- SAFER barriers a.k.a. 'soft' walls [@Valentine:2016]
- Carbon fiber monocoque [@Piola:2016]
- roll-over hoops [@Nye:2017]
- seat belts / harnesses [@Nye:2017]
