## D1 distributions

State the number of observations: 706

List the variables:

  - Post Graduation Earnings
  - School Type: Public and Private
  - Student ACT performance: Above and Below average

State the graph type: Strip Plot

Explain why the graph type is suited to the data structure:

  - Since there is not a huge number of observations, a strip plot
    depicts the actual data.
  - There are four clear categories, and the reader will want to compare
    them
  - etc

Explain each design choice and cite its supporting reference

  - I grouped the Above and Below average test score categories, because
    students wanting to know the best path will know which group they
    fit into based on their own test scores. This choice makes it easier
    for the audience to answer their own question. Wainer, Howard (2014)
  - choice, reference

Comments from peers

Improvements to be made: - Add a line for median salary in each
category? - Format X axis in standard currency form
