D1 Box Plot
================

## D1: Strip Plot

  - Introductory prose to start each report describing the data and the
    requirements being met (from R Markdown basics)
  - Describe the type of story being told with relevant citations—recall
    the paper by Doumont (2009)
  - Explain how the graph design is appropriate to the data structure
  - Explain your rationale for important design elements with relevant
    citations
  - Explain the application of basic principles in graph design and
    visual rhetoric that we have discussed and that you have noted in
    your discussion notes (reading responses, video reflections, and
    presentation notes) with relevant citations

This display meets the requirements for D1 distribution data display:

  - Minimum 200 observations of one quantitative variable
  - One or two categorical variables
  - Time is excluded as a variable
  - Two categorical variables, with two levels each for a minimum of
    four comparisons.

This data is derived from MONEY’s I can not find what year this data is
from, which limits the conclusions we can draw from the context. From
browsing MONEY’s college rankings, I determined this dataset is from no
later than 2014, so current prospective college students should not
place stock in decisions from this display. However, at the time this
data was current, it offered a great insight into the profile of
students entering colleges across the US.

Choosing the correct data to include in a report is incredibly important
because “displays of evidence implicitly but powerfully define the scope
of the relevant, as presentd data are selected from a larger pool of
material” (Tufte, [1997](#ref-Tufte:1997))

Notes to myself on improvements to be made:

  - Communicate how the rows are ordered
  - essay: include limitations on data, talk about techincal and
    rhetorical choices
  - Show Above and Below average correspond to ACT scores
  - Cite data source in figure caption
  - Format X axis in standard currency form
