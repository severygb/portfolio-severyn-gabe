Wildfires are a natural disaster experienced across the globe. California and Australia had record-breaking fires in the last two years with unprecendeted environmental and human consequences. Studying the patterns of wild fires with the intention of modeling and predicting potential blazes is a difficult but important field. This chart explores the relationship between temperature, the Fine Fuel Moisture code (FFMC), and the resulting burned area. [Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/) is from fires in the Montesinho natural park in Portugal, taken from 2000 to 2003 [@Cortez:2007]. Each of the 517 dots represents a fire event with environmental data evaluated near the time of ignition.

As temperature increases, fires tend to burn a greater area. In the bottom left panel, corresponding to 0C-17C, no fire burned over 100 hectares. When the temperature increases, the largest fires get even larger. In the top right panel, corresponding to 22-34C, the largest fires burn over 1000 hectares. Burned area is skewed to smaller values, as small fires are much more common than large fires.

Fine fuel coisture code (FFMC) is a metric included in the Canadian forest fire weather index (FWI) system, commonly used to rate fire danger on any given day as well as quantify the intensity of a blaze. FFMC measures the moisture content of easily ignited fuels and is an indicator of flammability [@FWI]. FFMC and area burned do not appear to have a correlation in these fires. Interestingly, the other FWI metrics included in the data (duff moisture code, drought code, initial spread index) behaved in the same way - with little to no correlation present. This suggests an additional unobserved factor at play, perhaps related how quickly the burn is detected or to the severity of fire suppression response.

This represents the factors relevant to the geographic area in the Montesinho park. There may be variables specific to that area that drive the observed relationship, so these conclusions can likely be extended to a similar geography or even climate. In other regions with vastly different terrain, the factors to predict fire damage are likely different and will require a similar study to determine them.

## Graph design
 
Data requirements: D6 multivariate

- Minimum 20 observations
- Three or more quantitative variables
- Time is excluded as a variable
- Categorical variables are possible, depending on the graph type.

A conditional plot is appropriate for this data set because it explores the correlation or dependence between three continuous quantitative variables. Burned area (the 'output' variable) is placed on the x-axis to facilitate easier comparison across the panels. Like all of the other plots in this portfolio, it uses similar design choices for consistency and emphazising the data.
