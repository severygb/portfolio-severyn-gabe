**RL comments**

ACT scores are quantitative, suggests a scatterplot because you said you
were interested in a correlation between ACT score and potential
earnings

What is the provenance of the data? How many years? What set of
colleges? etc.

**RL** I could not fix the knitr problem with relative file paths. So I
have used a workaround. See the work I added to the
`0301-markdowen-basics.Rmd` script. Before knitting the script, install
the `magick` package.
