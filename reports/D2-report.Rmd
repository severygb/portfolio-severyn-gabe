Commercial vessels based in the United States are pushing the limits of ship design life. In nearly all types, there are more vessels over 25 years old than in any other age range. Typical design life for commercial maritime vessels is 20-30 years [@Dinu+Ilie:2015]. This means a large portion of the US fleet is operating at near or past the designed service life.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "90%"}   
include_graphics("../figures/D2-vessels-1.png")    
```

However, operating ships beyond designed limits is not uncommon in the maritime shipping industry. In 2013, the global average age of a ship was over 20 years [@Dinu+Ilie:2015]. Given the massive costs to design, construct, and operate large vessels, owners want to maximize their life and return on investment.

There are a few exceptions to the trend of operating old vessels. Crewboats are the only vessel type where >25 years old is not the largest category, which I could not find an explanation for. There are more tankers <6 years old than expected because The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990, prompted by the Exxon Valdez environmental disaster, began to require double-hull vessels as an added protection against oil spills. This required replacing  ships with new ones. However, there is still a lot of updating to do, because 84% of the US tanker fleet is over 16 years old.

This data came from Freight Facts and Figures, a report published by the Bureau of Transportation chock full of data on goods transportation in and around the US. It is intended to provide "a snapshot" of the industry to help "decision makers, planners, and the public understand the magnitude and importance of freight transportation to the economy" [@FFF:2017]. This lofty goal is not achieved well, because the writers just did not have much to say. Below is their 'snapshot' of the water-going vessels the US economy relies on.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}

```

The third section of the table is relevent- the median age of vessel types. Perhaps the report writers knew the fleet was aging, and tried to bring attention to it. However, in graphing the data that story becomes more evident. Prose surrounding the table offers no further conclusions, only mentioning the size of the fleet decreased between 2000 and 2014 [@FFF:2017].

## Graph design

Data requirements:

- One quantitative variable with a minimum of 24 observations
- Two independent categorical variables with one of the following combinations,
  - 3 levels in category 1 and at least 8 levels in category 2
  - 4 levels in category 1 and at least 6 levels in category 2
  - 5 levels in category 1 and at least 5 levels in category 2

A multiway is appropriate because this data consists of a single quantitative value with two categorical variables. The original data is presented in percentage form; this allows easy comparison of the age within a single type, but inhibits comparison between types. To facilitate this, I converted the data to raw counts. This involved difficult data wrangling, because the totals of each type were presented in a separate row.

The plots use a log scale, because the counts span three orders of magnitude. This scale allows visual differentiation of the smaller values. Labels for numbers of vessels are sparse enough to read as full numbers with no overprinting, and are formatted with commas for immediate readability. The age category is ordered in increasing order, as it is a numerical variable. Ordering the age categories in any other way would cause confusion.

Both variations of the multiway were examined, switching the facet and y axis categories. The multiway presented above better aligns the visual logic with the arguments I make in prose. Using vessel type on the y axis and faceting by age highlighted the numerical distribution of vessel types. For example, it showed that dry barges are the most numerous vessels and tankers are the least common.
