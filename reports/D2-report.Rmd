There are more tankers <6 years old than expected by the trend, because The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of
1990, prompted by the Exxon Valdez environmental disaster, began to require double-hull vessels as an added protection against oil spills. This required replacing existing existing ships with new ones. However, there is still a lot of updating to do, because 84% of the US tanker fleet is over 16 years old.

Freight Facts and Figures is a report published by the Bureau of Transportation chock full of data on the transportation of goods in and around the US. It is intended to provide "a snapshot" of the industry to help "decision makers, planners, and the public understand the magnitude and importance of freight transportation to the economy" [@FFF:2017]. This lofty goal is not achieved well. Below is their 'snapshot' of the water-going vessels the US economy relies on.

If I was a decision-maker, I would decide to look elsewhere for more digestible evidence. A cluttered table may be acceptable for compactly publishing data, but not for presenting findings or furthering the public's understanding. Prose surrounding the table offers no meaningful conclusions, only mentioning the size of the fleet decreased between 2000 and 2014 [@FFF:2017]. Re-flowing this data into a graphical form is far more informative.

"U.S. flag vessels include a wide range of vessel types that are used to move freight around the
globe. However, shallow draft vessels (barges and towboats) make up 93.8 percent of the fleet
and operate domestically on intracoastal waterways and river systems. Our inland waterways
provide an alternative to truck and rail transportation, a barge can carry an amount equal to or
greater than 15 railcars or 60 large semi-truck trailers.
Overall, the U.S. fleet decreased by more than 1,272 vessels (3.1 percent) between 2000 and
2014, largely due to the retirement of dry bulk barges. An increase in the percentage of tankers
and liquid bulk barges 10 or less years old was largely driven by The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of
1990, which required double hulls by January 1, 2015. Double hulls provide greater protection
to the marine environment from spills caused by collisions or groundings." (42)

investigate any visual anomalies: LB-11-15, Towboat 6-10, or more


## Graph design

A multiway is appropriate for this data because it is coordinatized; each measurement can be fully identified by keys type and age [@Mount:2017]. A multiway representes coordanitized data well because it shows a single numerical value under two categorical variables. The original data is presented in percentage form; this allows easy comparison of the age in a single type, but inhibits comparison between types. I have converted the data to raw numbers, so comparison across types is easier. This involved a lot of data wrangling, because the type totals are presented in a separate row.

The plots use a log scale, because the counts span three orders of magnitude. This scale allows visual differentiation of the smaller values. Labels for numbers of vessels are sparse enough to read as full numbers with no overprinting, and are formatted with commas for immediate readability. The age category is ordered in increasing order, as it would be if it was a numerical variable. Ordering the age categories in any other way would cause confusion.

Both variations of the multiway were examined, switching the facet and y axis categories. The multiway presented above better aligns the visual logic with the arguments I make in prose. Using vessel type on the y axis and faceting by age highlighted the numerical distribution of vessel types. For example, it showed that dry barges are the most numerous vessels and tankers are the least common.
