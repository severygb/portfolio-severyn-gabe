## Introduction

This display illustrates the distribution of speeds attained by skiers
in three downhill events in the 2012 Olympic Winter Games disaggregated
by sex.

## Requirements 

This display meets the data requirements for D1 distributions

- 250 observations 
- One quantitative variable (speed) 
- Two categorical variables: sex (2 levels) and event (3 levels)  

This display also meets the following document requirements 

- sports data limit (this display is one of two) 


The following is a glimpse of StarWars characters.
```{r}
data(starwars, package = "dplyr")

glimpse(starwars)


starwars %>% select(films) %>% unlist() %>% unique()
```


Graph of worlds and number of characters all it home.
```{r}
starwars_worlds <- starwars %>% 
    filter(!is.na(homeworld)) %>% 
    select(homeworld) %>% 
    count(homeworld) %>% 
    filter(n > 1) %>% 
    mutate(homeworld = forcats::fct_reorder(homeworld, n))

ggplot(starwars_worlds, aes(x = n, y = homeworld)) +
    geom_point(size = 1.5) +
    labs(x = "Character count (for N > 1)",
       y = "",
       title = "Home worlds of Star Wars characters") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 2, to = 10, by = 2)) +
    theme_graphclass()
```

This is the output of a separate R script.

```{r}
source("explore/0204-more-R-basics.R")
glimpse(df)

ggplot(df, aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line()
```

Aaaand after that brief interruption, we return to StarWars data.

```{r}
starwars_worlds %>% 
    arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
    kable()
```


-------------- Must have a space here before the heading line


## Try include_graphics



Bring it in...

```{r out.width = "10%"}
# import an image from resources 
# include_graphics("resources/Rlogo.png")
```


OK, this works, using markdown syntax. 

![](../resources/Rlogo.png) 

It does not however allow you to control the image size. To do that, let's install the `magick` package.  

```{r}
# read the iamge
my_img <- image_read("resources/Rlogo.png")

# how large is the figure?
image_info(my_img)

# scale to width (in pixels) 
my_img  <- image_scale(my_img, "50")

# write scaled versioon to file
image_write(my_img, 
        path = "resources/Rlogo-scaled.png", 
        format = "png")
```


Then import this scaled version

![](../resources/Rlogo-scaled.png)
